<h1>I am a participant in a Collector experiment - how is my data encrypted and decrypted?</h1>
A public key is used to encrypt data, whereas a private key is used to decrypt data. The researcher will have created a public key that is paired with a private key. This public key can be seen by anyone, including you, and is used to encrypt your data on your device. This means that no-one can steal your data while you are sending it, because itâ€™s already encrypted before you send the data anywhere. <br><br>
The researcher has used a password that only they (and perhaps other researchers on the project) know to encrypt their private key. This means that only people who know the password will be able to use the private key, and this is how the researcher is the only person who can decrypt your data.
