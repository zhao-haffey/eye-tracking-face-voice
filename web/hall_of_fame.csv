Dr. Nate Kornell,photos/NateKornell.jpg,"""Without Nate there would be no Collector. Many years ago Nate taught me how to use the tool he had created for himself, Generic, and that code inspired me to write Collector. Most of the core ideas and design decision at the heart of this project are either directly lifted from Nate's program or were based on adaptations of what he had created."" - Mikey Garcia"
