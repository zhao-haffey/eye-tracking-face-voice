Thank you for participating in our study. <br>
We were interested in examining how self-reported social networking, alcohol addiction and other personality traits predict which images you looked longer at.
We are interested in whether you looked longer at images associated with addictive stimuli, i.e. alcohol or social networking, compared to visually similar images.<br><br>
Following this debrief, we would like to remind you that you are free to withdraw your data at any time without needing to provide a reason. 
If you feel any adverse effects from the study in general, you can contact the principle supervisor Dr Anthony Haffey or the postgraduate researcher, 
Joseph Forrest, via the contact information provided on this debrief sheet.<br><br>
If you still have concerns, sources of support will also be provided on the next page.",instruct,,,,,
