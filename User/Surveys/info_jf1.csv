We would be grateful if you could assist us by participating in our online study. <br>
<br>
<b> What is the study investigating? </b> <br>
We are investigating behaviour related to addiction. In this research you will complete questionnaires, some of which relate to depression, addiction, alcohol, social networking and difficult experiences from childhood, and an eye-tracking task when viewing pairs of images including images involving alcohol and social networking. The eye-tracking will just use the web-camera on your device and does not require wearing any device. The task tends to work much better on laptops than desktops with mounted cameras so we would recommend continuing or restarting the task on a laptop. The purpose of the study is to determine if individual differences influence attentional behaviour. Your participation in this study will require one 30-minute session.  
<br><br>
<b> What data be stored? </b> <br>
We will use your webcam to track where you are looking during the eye tracking task. You do not need any specialist equipment for this task - just a webcam. Furthermore, and most importantly, we will not record any videos or pictures, but only the co-ordinates of where we think you are looking. We will also store your questionnaire results.<br>
<br>
<b> How will my data be stored? </b> <br>
Your data will be kept confidential and securely stored, with only an anonymous number identifying it. Data collected from this study will be preserved and made publicly available in anonymised form, so that data can be re-used by others. No video will be collected or stored, your webcam will only be used to estimate where you are looking on the screen.<br>
<br>
<b>Are there any risks associated with taking part?</b><br>Some of the questionnaires may include material of a sensitive nature. Thus, the study may include a mild risk of anxiety, sadness or other emotional reactions. <br>
<br>
<b> Do I have to take part? </b> <br>
Taking part in this study is completely voluntary; you may withdraw at any time without having to give any reason. <br>
<br>
<b> Will I be compensated?</b><br>
 <H1>You will receive 0.5 credits through SONA.</H1><br>
